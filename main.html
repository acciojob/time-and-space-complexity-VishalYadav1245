<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>
Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm changes with input size. 
Understanding <b>Time complexity</b> helps us determine whether a solution is efficient.
</p>

<p>
<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses. 
It helps us analyze whether a program uses memory efficiently and understand 
how it behaves as inputs grow in size, often expressed using O(n).
